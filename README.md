# Transfer-Learning-Digit-Classification

This was part of my advanced machine learning class. The task was to use a convolutional neural network for digit classification. However we only had 500 labeled images, but approximatly 72'000 unlabeled images. I used a transfer learning approach, where the network had to predict the rotation of unlabeled handwritten digits. Then I used the head as feature extraction for my model to predict the digit. The final model achieved 80% accuracy on this task.
